# To-Do-List-JS
An assignment I completed for a buddy. The assignment was creating a To-Do list with JavaScript. The assignment asked to include the use of a parent class for the list's tasks, as well as child classes inheriting from this main class. The inheriting child classes include methods of their own that create tasks of different categories. Moreover, the assignment asked to make us of the local storage JavaScript API to save tasks created by the client. Additionally, the assignment asked to use the HTML drag and drop API in order to rearange the order of the tasks on the list.

app.js is a bit spaghetti; I completed the assignment in one sitting.
